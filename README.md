# Space Shoooter Demo

This is mostly a way for me to get back into Unity and try the [DOTween](https://dotween.demigiant.com/) asset.
Code is sometimes sloppy but I just wanted something mildly fun, somewhat good looking, and that worked.
I might go back to it and make it releasable in the far future.
